# titanic-survivors-classifiers

A machine learning classification model camparison for survivor prediction of the sinking of the RMS Titanic from passenger data.

## Problem Definition

Given a labelled dataset of features about passengers aboard the titanic and whether or not they survived. Can we train a classification model to accurately predict the survival of passengers from an unlabelled dataset.

### Methodology

1. We will firstly inspect the data and determine which features are important to include in our models.
2. We will then engineer the selected features such that they are in a form convenient for modelling.
3. We will then fit and evaluate a number of models.
4. Finally, we will compare the accuracy of the various models and select the best performing model.

### Modelling

To determine an accurate model the following classfification models were used:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree Classification
- Random Forest Classification
